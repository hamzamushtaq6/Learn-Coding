    <p>An unnamed narrator, disillusioned with his corporate job and consumer-driven life. Struggling with insomnia, he meets the
    eccentric Tyler Durden, and together they form an underground fight club as a form of male empowerment and release. As
    the club grows into a nationwide anti-establishment movement, the narrator discovers Tyler is a figment of his
    imagination, representing his darker desires. The narrator battles with this alter ego to regain control of his life,
    leading to a climactic confrontation with Tyler's anarchist plan to destroy corporate debt records.</p>
